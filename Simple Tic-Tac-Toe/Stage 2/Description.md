# The user is the gamemaster
 Hard
 ## Description
Our program should be able to display the grid at all stages of the game. Now we’re going to write a program that allows the user to enter a string representing the game state and correctly prints the 3x3 game grid based on this input. We’ll also add some boundaries around the game grid.

## Objectives
In this stage, you will write a program that:

1. Reads a string of 9 symbols from the input and displays them to the user in a 3x3 grid. The grid can contain only X, O and _ symbols.
2. Outputs a line of dashes --------- above and below the grid, adds a pipe | symbol to the beginning and end of each line of the grid, and adds a space between all characters in the grid.
## Examples
Examples below show how your output should look.
Notice that after Enter cells: comes the user input.

### Example 1:
```
Enter cells: O_OXXO_XX
---------
| O _ O |
| X X O |
| _ X X |
---------
```
### Example 2:
```
Enter cells: OXO__X_OX
---------
| O X O |
| _ _ X |
| _ O X |
---------
```
### Example 3:
```
Enter cells: _XO__X___
---------
| _ X O |
| _ _ X |
| _ _ _ |
---------
```
