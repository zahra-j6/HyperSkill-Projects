# Grader

## Description
Let's add some interactivity to our program. The program should create a 4-digit secret code, and the player should try to guess it on the first try. The program should give a grade to evaluate how accurate the player was.

As you remember, a correctly guessed digit is a cow, and if its position is also correct, then it is a bull. After the player tries to guess the secret code, the program should grade the attempt and finish the execution.

For example, if the secret code is ```9305```, then:

1. The number ```9305``` contains 4 bulls and 0 cows since all 4 digits are correct and their positions are correct as well. It's the only number that can contain 4 bulls, so it's also the secret code itself.
2. The numbers ```3059```, ```3590```, ```5930```, ```5039``` contain 0 bulls and 4 cows since all 4 digits are correct but their positions don't match the positions in the secret code.
3. The numbers ```9306```, ```9385```, ```9505```, ```1305``` contain 3 bulls.
4. The numbers ```9350```, ```9035```, ```5309```, ```3905``` contain 2 bulls and 2 cows.
5. The numbers ```1293```, ```5012```, ```3512```, ```5129``` contain 0 bulls and 2 cows.
6. The numbers ```1246```, ```7184```, ```4862```, ```2718``` contain 0 bulls and 0 cows.
Note that guesses can contain repetitive digits, so:

The number 1111 contains 0 bulls and 0 cows.
The number 9999 contains 1 bull and 3 cows.
The number 9955 contains 2 bulls and 2 cows.
Objectives
In this stage, your goal is to write the core part of the game: the grader.

Your program should take a 4-digit number as an input.
Use a predefined 4-digit code and grade the answer that was input. You can do it digit by digit.
The grade is considered correct if it contains number-and-word pairs (like X bulls and Y cows) that give the correct information. If the answer doesn't contain any bulls and cows, you should output None.

## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space > represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

### Example 1
```
> 1234
Grade: 1 cow(s). The secret code is 9305.
```
### Example 2
```
> 9087
Grade: 1 bull(s) and 1 cow(s). The secret code is 9305.
```
### Example 3
```
> 1267
Grade: None. The secret code is 9305.
