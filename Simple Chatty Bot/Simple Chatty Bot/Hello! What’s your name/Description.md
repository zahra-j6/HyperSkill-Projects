# Chatty Bot welcomes you

## Description
Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.

## Objective
For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:
```
Hello! My name is {botName}.
I was created in {birthYear}.
```

Instead of ```{botName}```, print any name you choose and replace {birthYear} with the current year (four digits).

## Example
Output:
```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
```
You can change the text if you want but print exactly two lines.

Next, we will use Aid and 2020 as your bot's name and its birth year, but you can change it if you need to.
