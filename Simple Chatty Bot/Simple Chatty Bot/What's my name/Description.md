# Print your name  (Stage 2)
 Medium

## Description
The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. It's time to implement this functionality.

## Objective
In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.

Your program should print the following lines:

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {yourName}!
```
You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.

Instead of ```{yourName}```, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.

## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

### Example 1: a dialogue with the bot
```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
```
Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text but not the number of printed lines.
